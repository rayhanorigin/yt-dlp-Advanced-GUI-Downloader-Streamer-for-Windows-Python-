## 🛠️ Pre-Requirements (Important)

To run this tool smoothly on Windows, you need three core helper components installed on your computer. Don't worry—they are simple to set up!

1.  **Python 3.x:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation).
2.  **FFmpeg:** Required for merging high-quality audio and video tracks together. 
    * *Tip:* You can place `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` directly into the script's folder, or add them to your Windows System PATH.
3.  **Node.js (Recommended):** Used as the JavaScript runtime engine to extract complex video links. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Media Players (Optional for Streaming)
* **MPV Player:** Place `mpv.exe` in the script's folder or add it to your PATH.
* **VLC Media Player:** Ensure VLC is installed in its default location (`C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC`).

## 💡 Quick Tips for Your Ease

> 🥷 **Bypassing Access/Sign-in Blocks:**
> If you encounter download blocks or errors on certain websites, place your exported `cookies.txt` file directly into the script's folder. The app will automatically detect it and instantly activate the **"Inject cookies.txt parameter profile"** option to bypass restrictions securely! Alternatively, use the **"Cookies from browser"** option from Advanced section.
